;;; Commentary:

;; For example, if you want to use company-elisp for auto-complete,
;; put following to your .emacs:
;;
;; (require 'ac-company)
;; (ac-company-define-source ac-source-company-elisp company-elisp)
;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
;;        (lambda () 
;;          (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-company-elisp)))
;;
;; You can overrides attributes. For example, if you want to add
;; symbol to ac-source-company-elisp, put following:
;;
;; (ac-company-define-source ac-source-company-elisp company-elisp
;;                           (symbol . "s"))


;;; Code:

(require 'auto-complete)
(require 'company nil t)

(defmacro ac-company-define-source (name backend &rest overrides)
  "Define auto-complete source NAME from company BACKEND.
When OVERRIDES is specified, OVERRIDES is prepend to original source."
  `(defvar ,name
     '(,@overrides
       (candidates . (ac-company-candidates ',backend))
       (prefix . (ac-company-prefix ',backend))
       (document . (lambda (item) (ac-company-document ',backend item))))))
  
(defun ac-company-prefix (backend)
  (require backend nil t)
  (when (fboundp backend)
    (let ((prefix (funcall backend 'prefix)))
      (when (stringp prefix) 
	(- (point) (length prefix))))))
