;;; Commentary:

;; So you've just added an incorrect entry to auto-mode-alist and want
;; to fix it quickly.  `M-x edit-list RET auto-mode-alist RET' to the
;; rescue.  Make your changes and hit either `C-x C-s' or `C-c C-c'
;; when done.  Or just kill the buffer if you change your mind.

;;; History:

;; 0.3:
;;
;; - Grab list name at point.
;;
;; - Limit completions to lists.
;;
;; - Set buffer-modified-p to nil when buffer is ready for user edits.
;;
;; - Handle edge case where argument passed to `edit-list' is an
;;   unbound symbol.

;; 0.2: Add completion for symbols, header, footer, and (require 'pp).

;; 0.1: Initial release.

;;; Contributors:

;; rubikitch (rubikitch AT ruby-lang.org) provided a solution for
;; completing symbol names.

;; Rupert Swarbrick (rswarbrick AT gmail.com) provided the initial
;; implementations for defaulting to the list name at point and
;; limiting the completions to names of lists.
