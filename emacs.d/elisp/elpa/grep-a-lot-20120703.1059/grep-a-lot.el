;;; Commentary:

;; This package manages multiple search results buffers:
;; - the search results of grep, lgrep, rgrep, and find-grep are sent
;;   to separate buffers instead of overwriting the contents of a single
;;   buffer (buffers are named *grep*<N> where N is a number)
;; - several navigation functions are provided to allow the user to treat
;;   the search results buffers as a stack and/or ring, and to easily reset
;;   the state of each search buffer after navigating through the results
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; 1. Put this file in a directory that is a member of load-path, and
;;    byte-compile it (e.g. with `M-x byte-compile-file') for better
;;    performance.
;; 2. Add the following to your ~/.emacs:
;;    (require 'grep-a-lot)
;;    (grep-a-lot-setup-keys)
;; 3. If you're using igrep.el you may want to add:
;;    (grep-a-lot-advise igrep)
;;
;; Currently, there are no customization options.
;;    
;; Default Key Bindings:
;;
;; Ring navigation:
;; M-g ]         Go to next search results buffer, restore its current search context
;; M-g [         Ditto, but selects previous buffer.
;;               Navigation is cyclic.
;;
;; Stack navigation:
;; M-g -         Pop to previous search results buffer (kills top search results buffer)
;; M-g _         Clear the search results stack (kills all grep-a-lot buffers!)
;;
;; Other:
;; M-g =         Restore buffer and position where current search started
;;
