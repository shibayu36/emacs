;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is a module to allow the use of the fringe to indicate locations
;; relative to the bounds of the buffer.  rfringe = "relative fringe".
;;
;; In emacs, displaying fringe indicators is done via text overlays. In
;; that way, bitmaps in the fringe are attached to the lines of text
;; shown in the buffer window.
;;
;; This works nicely when the fringe is used to indicate information
;; that is relevant to the adjacent line; for example, text overflow, or
;; something similar. But, there isn't a simple way for an application
;; or module to use the fringe to display buffer-relative information -
;; for example, the location of compiler error messages.
;;
;; In fact, using the fringe to communicate this kind of information -
;; buffer-relative positions - is probably more intuitive and is
;; certainly more useful for the user. For example, consider the
;; scrollbar. The position and size of the scrollbar indicates to the
;; user the position and size of the current window relative to the
;; entire buffer. This is information that cound not be easily or
;; appropriately conveyed within the visual text. The fringe is
;; perfectly suited for this purpose.
;;
;; Along those lines, a useful integration of fringe with flymake would
;; be to use fringe bitmaps visually indicate the position of all
;; flymake errors and warnings in the buffer, relative to the beginning
;; and end of the buffer. A quick glance at the fringe would give a
;; visual indication of the number of errors or warnings and their
;; approximate positions.
;;
;; Likewise, a diff mode might want to display fringe indicators for the
;; number and approximate relative position of differences.
;;
;; Doing this is not simple, because of the dependency of fringe bitmaps
;; on text overlays that I described above.  To use the fringe to
;; communicate information regarding buffer-relative positions requires
;; a transformation from "buffer position" to "window position".  And
;; this transformation must be re-computed each time a window scrolls or
;; changes size.
;;
;; This module addresses that need, and provides that transformation. It
;; allows you to set an indicator that is buffer-relative in the fringe;
;; the indicator automatically redisplays if the window changes size, or
;; scrolls.
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;; 1. In the simplest case, you can use rfringe to provide a visual
;;    indicator of the top of the region in the buffer, like so:
;;
;;       (rfringe-show-region)
;;
;;    To turn off the indicator, do this:
;;
;;       (rfringe-hide-region)
;;
;;
;; 2. You can also use rfringe to display a set of indicators,
;;    corresponding to a set of locations in the buffer. These might be
;;    the locations of compiler errors, or section beginnings, or
;;    whatever you like.
;;
;;       (setq posns '(79 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 9000 10000))
;;       (mapc 'rfringe-create-relative-indicator posns)
;;
;;    As you scroll through the buffer, the indicators in the fringe remain fixed.
;;
;;    To remove the indicators, do this:
;;
;;       (rfringe-remove-managed-indicators)
;;
;;    By default, rfringe defines advice to extend flymake to display
;;    indicators this way.  This is not the only intended use of rfringe.el,
;;    but it is a good example.
