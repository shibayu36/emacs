;; `sudo' support in Emacs.
;; Currently it has two features.

;; * `sudoedit' command opens files as root using sudoedit program.
;;   This command needs emacsserver or gnuserv.
;;   Try M-x server-start or M-x gnuserv-start first.
;;   Be sure to you can run `sudoedit FILE' in shell.
;;   
;; * `sudo' support in shell execution in Emacs.
;;   In executing sudo shell command, password prompt is appeared if needed.
;;   * M-x compile
;;   * M-x grep
;;   * M-!
;;   * M-|
;;   * M-&
;;   * M-x executable-interpret
