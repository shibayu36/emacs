;;; Overview:
;;
;; DWIM stands for "do what I mean", as in the idea that one keystroke
;; can do different things depending on the context. In this package,
;; it means that, if the cursor is in a currently hidden folded
;; construction, we want to show it; if it's not, we want to hide
;; whatever fold the cursor is in.
;;
;; Some editors other than Emacs provide a single mechanism for
;; folding text which various file types can exploit.  The advantage
;; of this arrangement is that the user only has to know one set of
;; folding commands; the disadvantage is that the various file types
;; are limited to using whatever functionality is provided centrally.
;; Emacs by contrast provides a very general and powerful framework
;; for hiding text, which major modes can use as they see fit.  The
;; advantage of this is that each major mode can deal with folding in
;; the way that is suitable for that type of file; the disadvantage is
;; that different major modes have different styles of folding, and
;; provide different key bindings.
;;
;; In practice, matters are simpler than that, since most major modes
;; delegate the task of folding to packages like outline.el and
;; hideshow.el.  The key bindings for these two packages alone,
;; however, are numerous and for some people hard to type.  Another
;; usability complication arises when a package like AucTeX uses
;; outline-minor-mode for some folds, and provides its own
;; key-bindings for other kinds of folds.  Likewise, nXML-mode
;; provides its own style of folding for certain types of files, but
;; for files that don't fit that paradigm (such as XHTML), you may
;; want to use outline-minor-mode instead.
;;
;; The goal of this package is to reduce this complexity to three
;; globally-defined keystrokes: one to toggle the state of the fold at
;; point, whatever its type may be, one to hide all folds of all types
;; in the buffer, and one to show all folds.
;;
;; This package currently knows about folding-mode (from folding.el),
;; hs-minor-mode (from hideshow.el), outline-minor-mode (from
;; outline.el), TeX-fold-mode (from AUCTeX), and nXML-mode outlining.
;; More could be added.  It is not necessary to have folding.el,
;; AUCTeX or nXML-mode installed, if you just want to use it with the
;; built-in modes.

;;; Usage:
;;
;; You will need to have one or more of following minor modes switched
;; on: hs-minor-mode, outline-minor-mode, TeX-fold-mode, folding-mode.
;; Otherwise no folds may be found. There are three functions to try:
;;
;; fold-dwim-toggle: try to show any hidden text at the cursor; if no
;; hidden text is found, try to hide the text at the cursor.
;;
;; fold-dwim-hide-all: hide all folds in the buffer.
;;
;; fold-dwim-show-all: show all folds in the buffer.  

;;; Configuration
;;
;; This package binds no keys by default, so you need to find three
;; free and convenient key-bindings.  This is what I use:
;;
;;  (global-set-key (kbd "<f7>")      'fold-dwim-toggle)
;;  (global-set-key (kbd "<M-f7>")    'fold-dwim-hide-all)
;;  (global-set-key (kbd "<S-M-f7>")  'fold-dwim-show-all)
;;

;;; Advanced Configuration
;;
;; With respect to outline-minor-mode (or outline-mode), dwim-fold
;; provides two different styles of usage.  The first is a "nested"
;; style which only shows top-level headings when you fold the whole
;; buffer, and then allows you to drill down progressively through the
;; other levels.  The other is a "flat" style, whereby folding the
;; entire buffer shows all headings at every level.
;;
;; The default is "flat", but if you want to change the default, you
;; can set the value of fold-dwim-outline-style-default to be 'flat or
;; 'nested.  If you wish to override the default for a particular
;; major mode, put a value of either 'flat or 'nested for the
;; fold-dwim-outline-style property of the major-mode symbol, like so:
;;
;;   (put 'org-mode 'fold-dwim-outline-style 'nested)
;;
;; At present, there is no way to customize nXML-mode outlining to use
;; the nested style, since it is not really supported by that mode
;; (there is no function to hide all text and subheadings in the
;; buffer).

;;; Compatibility
;;
;; Tested with GNU Emacs CVS (from Sept. 10, 2004), AUCTeX version
;; 11.53, nxml-mode version 20041004, folding.el version 2.97.
;;
;; If there are any other important major or minor modes that do
;; folding and that could usefully be handled in this package, please
;; let me know.

;;; Bugs
;;
;; It is possible that some of the various folding modes may interact
;; badly if used together; I have not tested all permutations.
;;
;; The function fold-dwim-hide tries various folding modes in
;; succession, and stops when it finds one that successfully makes a
;; fold at point.  This means that the order in which those modes are
;; tried is significant.  I have not spent a lot of time thinking
;; about what the optimal order would be; all I care about is that
;; hideshow and TeX-fold have priority over outline-minor-mode (since
;; for me they usually fold smaller chunks of the file).
;;
;; I don't use folding.el myself, so that functionality is not well
;; tested.

;;; Changes
;;
;; 1.0 Initial release
;; 1.1 Bugfix: test if folding-mode is bound
;; 1.2 fold-dwim-hide-all and -show-all operate only on active region
;;     in transient-mark-mode.
;; 1.3 Added outline-mode (major mode)
