Changes in version 3.0.2.0

	Patched asp/php matching in font lock. It doesn't (hopefully)
	break the stack anymore.

Changes in version 3.0.2.1

	Fixed folding.el tags.  

	Fixed general tag matching regexp.

Changes in version 3.0.2.2

	Added a defcustom for a symbol meant to tell Emacs that it has to
	consider asp/php/jsp blocks beginning in column 1

	Added messages in the minibuffer while matching PHP/JSP/PHP blocks

	Added support for JSP (ALPHA)

	Added a defcustom for a symbol meant to tell Emacs that the page
	contains JSP and not ASP

Changes in version 3.0.3.0

	Experimental code to generate new faces under xemacs

Changes in version 3.0.3.2

	Fixed handling of the defcustom symbol meant to tell Emacs that
	the page contains JSP and not ASP

Changes in version 3.0.3.3

	Fixed regexp matching scripts in  html-helper-match-asp-php

	Fixed vesion number :)

Changes in version 3.0.3.4

	Inserted (require 'font-lock)

Changes in version 3.0.3.5

	Changed default value for html-helper-mode-uses-visual-basic: the
	default distribution does not offer visual-basic-mode.

	Changed comment matching. Used a function instead of a regexp. 
	Comments are used to hide script code from browsers that can't 
	handle them, and long comments can overflow the regexp stack.

	Geeeeeeeeeeeee, now it works even better than sgml/html mode :)

Changes in version 3.0.3.5bravo

	Peter Neergaard <turtle@bu.edu> suggests a correction that's 
	damn right on such regexpe like  \(<%=\s*\) \(<%=\w*\) 

Changes in version 3.0.3.5charlie

	Peter Neergaard <turtle@bu.edu> suggests a mode to overcome
	differences between Emacsen when dealing with font-lock faces


Changes in version 3.0.4

	Perepeee, it seems finally fixed! The mode-forth-and-back-kluge
	hack now works.  There's ta new alist with all the html-helper-mode 
	using buffer and the flavour they use ("HTML" "JSP" "PHP" "ASP").
	base-html-helper-mode puts each buffer in the list, an hook added
	to buffer-kill-hook removes it from the list.   
	Now html-script-release-region uses this list to setup the mode,
	the broken mechanism with the buffer-local variable is gone.

Changes in version 3.0.4bravo :
 
	Changed the way html-helper-mode-uses-JDE is set in the mode
	source, so that it automatically detects JDE.
	Added (require 'psgml-html) for XEmacs users (kind suggestion by
	XEmacs developer martin@xemacs.org)

	Changed ASP and comment blocks fontifying message

	Changes moved to this file (mode source was over 2000 lines).

	Changed highlighting, all the tags now are fontifyed the same
	way

		<entity attribute=value attribute="value">
	        ^~~~~~~ ^^^^^^^^^       ^^^^^^^^^ '''''''^

	Legenda
		^		font-lock-function-name-face
		~		html-tag-face
		^		font-lock-variable-name-face
		'		font-lock-string-face

	regexp for matching tags are simpler and there are
	more function to find the elements to color.

	Message during "repaint" are less heavy, no more point
	strips, but a little line spinning.

Changes in version 3.0.4charlie:

	Reworked indenting engine. Now indentation is uniform (2 character
	default). It recognizes  indentation sensible tags with attributes
	and  needs that they  tags stay  on separate  lines (C  mode needs
	curly braces on separate lines too, so this is acceptable :) )

Changes in version 3.0.4delta:

	Bug fix : html-helper-release-setup did use C-f12 instead of f4,
	now I set it to  html-script-toggle-key. Corrected modes docstring

Changes in version 3.0.4echo:

	Bug fix : Indenting engine was flawed by repeated code hidden in
	folding. Many thanks to Karel Sprenger, author of the fix.

Changes in version 3.0.4fox-trot:

	Bug fix: version number in 3.0.4echo was foobar.

	Bug fix: Jack Vinson supplies this code to handle the case when
	browse-url-browser-function is a list and not a function (it can be
	a list, says its documentation)

Changes in version 3.0.4golf:

	Bug fix: string-bytes doesn't exist in XEmacs

Changes in version 3.0.4hotel

	Bug fix: comment-region now works (comment-end must contain a
	simple string)

	Bug fix: fontifying messages don't overrun *Messages* anymore

Changes in version 3.0.4india

	Bug fix (XEmacs specific): hopefully Graham Gough found the way
	to fix face problems with XEmacs.

	Changed html-helper-insert-or-wipe so that it insert empty tag
	attributes if html-helper-mode-insert-attributes-always is non nil

	string-bytes re-entered the game due a file loss and restore :(
	
Changes in version 3.0.4Jolly

	Bug fix : html-helper-buffers doesnt' bloat anymore.
