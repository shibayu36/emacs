fragile
** LaTeX term **
Any command which expanded result changes by an argument.
Opposite is a robust command.

robust
** LaTeX term **
Commands which expanded results are always the same.
Font type/size selection commands, length commands, and most commands
used within math mode is robust.
(maketitle type commands that don't take any arguments)

protect
\protect `a fragile command'
Commands that the result changes according to it's arguments are
called "fragile commands".  When an argument is referenced in more
than one place, the command is said to "take a moving argument".
chapter and caption, whose argument will be used in the table of
contents, or an @ in an tabular/array environment are examples.

When a "fragile command" is used in a "moving argument", it must be
preceded by a \protect.  Following is an example.

\newcommand{\thissystem}[1]{YaTeX version #1}
\chapter{About \protect \thissystem{1.50}}

newcommand
\newcommand{\NAME}[ARGS]{DEF}
Define a macro \NAME as DEF, taking ARGS number of arguments.  The nth
argument will be referred as #n in the definition.
If used as
	\newcommand{\foo}[1]{\underline{#1}}
\foo{bar} will be expanded to \underline{bar}.  When a font selection
command is used as
	\newcommand{\foo}[1]{\bf #1}
\foo{bar} will be expanded as \bf bar in the text, so, it must be used as
	\newcommand{\foo}[1]{{\bf #1}}

If NAME is already defined as a macro, it will return an error.  To
redefine, use \renewcommand.

  (1st item)   (2nd item)     (3rd item)
   aabbcc      ddeeff      gghhii
               jjkkll      mmnnoo
               ppqqrr
   ssttuu      vvwwxx      yyzzzz
         \2em/       \3em/
Commands to control the tabbing environment are; (n starts from 1)
\=	Sets the nth tab stop position to the current position and increment
    the tab counter (n) by 1.
\\	Start a new line and reset the tab counter (n=1)
\>	Set the position to the nth tab stop and increment the tab counter by 1.
\+	Add 1 to the next line's tab counter's initial value.  If written as
    \+ \\, the next line's \> will give the position of the second tab
    stop.  Multiple \+ will accumulate tab counter's initial value.

\-	Reverse of \+.  Decrease initial value of tab counter for next line
    by 1.
\<	Decrease value of tab counter by 1 and set the tab stop.  Can be
    only used at the beginning of a line.
\'	Output at a position \tabbinsep right from the normal tab stop.
\`	Output remaining text flush-right.
\pushtabs Push all tab stop positions being used.
\poptabs  Push all tab stop positions being used. \pushtabs and \poptabs
          must be used in pairs.  Nesting allowed.
\aX	In a tabbing environment, accents are produced by \a=, \a', \a`
\kill	Without outputting text, parse tabbing definition.

\right(, \left) or \right{, left} or \right[, \left] or \right|, \left|
can enclose whole of array environment by parentheses, braces, brackets,
norm respectively.  The number of `\right's and `\left's should be the
same, but the type of parentheses don't have to match like
\right( \left].  `\right.' produces the invisible parenthesis.

Here are the style parameters for the tabular environment.
\arraycolsep    : half the width separating columns in an array environment
\tabcolsep      : half the width separating columns in a tabular environment
\arrayrulewidth : width of rules
\doublerulesep  : space between adjacent rules in array or tabular
\arraystretch   : line spacing in array and tabular environments is done by
                  placing a strut in every row of height and depth 
                  \arraystretch times the height and depth of the strut
                  produced by an ordinary \strut command.

Tabular environment cannot spread across pages.  `supertabular.sty'
allows this.

tabular*
\begin{tabular*}{WIDTH}{PREAMBLE} ... \end{tabular*}
Make tabular environment with specifying its width.
To fill this width, use \extracolsep{} of preamble as below:
\begin{tabular*}{10em}[b]{|c@{\extracolsep{\fill}}|c|c|}
 \hline
 a & b & c \\ \hline
 1 & 2 & 3
\end{tabular*}
See also tabular.

multicolumn
\multicolumn{N}{FORMAT}{ITEM}
In tabular environment,
replaces the next N column items by
ITEM, formatted according to FORMAT.  FORMAT should contain at most
one l,r or c.  If it contains none, then ITEM is ignored.

vline
\vline
In tabular environment,
draws a vertical line the height of the current row.  May
appear in an array element entry.


hline
\hline
In tabular environment draws a horizontal line between rows.  Must
appear either before the first entry (to appear above the first row) or
right after a \\ command.  If followed by another \hline, then adds a
\vskip of \doublerulesep.

cline
\cline{i-j}
In tabular environment,
draws horizontal lines between rows covering columns
i through j, inclusive.  Multiple commands may follow
one another to provide lines covering several disjoint
columns

extracolsep
\extracolsep{W}
for use inside an @ in the preamble.  Causes a WIDTH
space to be added between columns for the rest of the 
columns.  This is in addition to the ordinary intercolumn 
space.

picture
\begin{picture}(WIDTH,HEIGHT)(X,Y) ..contents.. \end{picture}
The picture  environment  allows you to create  just about any kind of
picture you want containing text, lines, arrows and circles.  You tell
LaTeX  where  to  put  things  in  the  picture  by  specifying  their
coordinates.   A coordinate  is a number that may have a decimal point
and a minus  sign  - a number  like  5, 2.3 or -3.1416.   A coordinate
specifies a length in multiples of the unit length \unitlength,  so if
\unitlength  has been set to 1cm, then the coordinate 2.54 specifies a
length of 2.54 centimeters.   You can change  the value of \unitlength
anywhere  you want, using the \setlength  command,  but strange things
will happen if you try changing it inside the picture environment.

A position is a pair of coordinates,  such as (2.4,-5), specifying the
point  with x-coordinate  2.4 and y-coordinate  -5.   Coordinates  are
specified  in the  usual  way  with  respect  to an origin,  which  is
normally  at the lower-left  corner of the picture.   Note that when a
position  appears as an argument,  it is not enclosed  in braces;  the
parentheses serve to delimit the argument.

The  picture  environment  has  one  mandatory  argument,  which  is a
position.   It specifies  the size  of the picture.   The  environment
produces  a rectangular  box with width and height determined  by this
argument's x- and y-coordinates.

The  picture  environment  also  has  an optional  position  argument,
following  the size argument,  that  can change  the origin.   (Unlike
ordinary optional arguments,  this argument is not contained in square
brackets.) The optional argument gives the coordinates of the point at
the lower-left corner of the picture (thereby determining the origin). 
For example, if \unitlength has been set to 1mm, the command

\begin{picture}(100,200)(10,20)

produces   a  picture   of  width  100  millimeters   and  height  200
millimeters,  whose lower-left  corner is the point (10,20)  and whose
upper-right  corner is therefore the point (110,220).   When you first
draw a picture,  you will  omit  the optional  argument,  leaving  the
origin  at the lower-left  corner.   If you then want  to modify  your
picture by shifting everything, you just add the appropriate  optional
argument.

The environment's  mandatory  argument determines  the nominal size of
the picture.   This need  bear  no relation  to how large  the picture
really  is; LaTeX will happily  allow  you to put things  outside  the
picture, or even off the page.  The picture's  nominal size is used by
TeX in determining how much room to leave for it.

Everything that appears in a picture is drawn by the \put command. The
command

\put (11.3,-.3){...}

puts the object specified  by "..." in the picture, with its reference
point at coordinates  (11.3,-.3).   The reference  points  for various
objects will be described below.

The \put command creates an LR box.  You can put anything  in the text
argument  of the \put command  that you'd put into the argument  of an
\mbox and related  commands.   When you do this,  the reference  point
will be the lower left corner of the box.

Picture environment is obsolete I thinks, so show only commands.

[[COMMANDS]]
\put(X,Y){OBJECT}
\multiput(X,Y)(dX,dY){REPEAT}{OBJECT}
[[OBJECTS]]
\makebox(X,Y)[POS]{TEXT}
\framebox(X,Y)[POS]{TEXT}
\dashbox(X,Y)[POS]{TEXT}
(POS = l, r, b, t)
\line(dX,dY){HorizontalLength}
\vector(dX,dY){HorizontalLength}		(arrow)
(dX,dY = +-1, +-2, ..., +-6)
\shortstack[POS]{FIRST\\SECOND\\THIRD...}
\circle{DIAMETER}
\circle*{DIAMETER}				(Filled circle)
(Maximum diameters are 40pt, 15pt)
\oval(Dia-X,DiaY)[POS]				(Oval POS = l, r, t, b)
\frame{OBJECT}
\thinlines, \thicklines				(choose line thickness)
\linethickness{THICKNESS}

newtheorem
\newtheorem{NAME}{TEXT}[COUNTER]	\newtheorem{NAME}[OLDNAME]{TEXT} 
This defines the environment NAME to be just as one would expect a 
theorem environment to be, except that it prints ``TEXT'' instead of 
``Theorem''.  

If OLDNAME is given, then environments NAME and OLDNAME use the same 
counter, so using a NAME environment advances the number of the next 
NAME environment, and vice-versa.

If COUNTER is given, then environment NAME is numbered within COUNTER.
E.g., if COUNTER = subsection, then the first NAME in subsection 7.2
is numbered TEXT 7.2.1.

The way NAME environments are numbered can be changed by redefining
\theNAME.

Macro to produce a TYPE entry in a table of contents, etc.
It will appear in the .TOC or other file.  For example,
The entry for subsection 1.4.3 in the table of contents might
be produced by:
\contentsline{subsection}{\makebox{30pt}[r]{1.4.3} Gnats and Gnus}{22}

abbrv	omit the first name of author, publishing month, book title

thebibliography
\begin{thebibliography}{LONGEST-LABEL} \bibitem{ITEM},... \end{thebibliography}
The thebibliography environment is a list environment.  To save the
use of an extra counter, it should use  enumiv  as the item counter.
Instead of using \item, items in the bibliography are produced by the 
\bibitem command.
LONGEST-LABEL is a dummy string to notify the maximum width of label.
---
<refer bibitem>

bibitem
\bibitem{NAME}			\bibitem[LABEL]{NAME}
Produces a numbered (as [1], [2],...) entry cited as NAME.
Second form produces an entry labeled by LABEL and cited as NAME.

thefootnote
In usual LaTeX style, produces the footnote number.
If footnotes are to be numbered within pages, then the 
document style file must include an \@addtoreset command 
to cause the footnote counter to be reset when the page 
counter is stepped.  This is not a good idea, though,
because the counter will not always be reset in time
to ensure that the first footnote on a page is footnote
number one.  

footnote
\footnote{NOTE}   or   \footnote[NUM]{NOTE}
User command to insert a footnote.
In second form, insert a footnote numbered
NUM, where NUM is a number -- 1, 2,
etc.  For example, if footnotes are numbered
*, **, etc. within pages, then \footnote[2]{...}
produces footnote '**'.  This command does not
step the footnote counter.

If you want footnote number as marks, define as follows in preamble;
\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}}

The next definition produces dagger marks followed by sequential number.
\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{$\dagger$\arabic{footnote}}
(fragile)

footnotemark

The *-variants of these commands is the same, except that spaces
print as the TeXbook's space character instead of as blank spaces.

styleparameter

topfigrule
\topfigrule
